This IOT project was created with the goal of triggering a door mechanism by using machine vision. The components used were: a Raspberry Pi 3, a usb camera, and a servo motor. The Raspberry Pi runs a custom python script that scans license plates and compares it with those stored from an approved database. If it is a match it, then it triggers the servo motor which will open the door.
